Introduction
============
Walls and Holes is a 2D to 3D map editor which lets you develop maps for your games. The primary feature is converting a 2D tile map into a useable 3D mesh. Walls and Holes focuses on speed and ease of use.

Getting Started
================

Here we choose the initial size of the map, whether it's indoors or outdoors, and whether if the map will have a ceiling or not. After creating the new map you will see a grid of empty sqaures, and now you can draw on the map using the *Wall* template.

The Tile Template System
========================

Overview
--------
The tile template system is for users to define different tiles which can output differing meshes.

Creating New Tile Template Sets
-------------------------------
Tile templates will be stored in tile template sets. To create a new Tile Template set press the |plus| button in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen, then you will be greeted by the following prompt:

.. |plus|	image:: images/add.png
			:width: 16
			:height: 16

.. image:: images/TiletempPrompt.png
   :align: center
  
*New Tile Template Set Prompt*

Enter the desired file directory which the Tile Template Set will be saved, it is recommended that you save the Tile Template Set and the map files in the same directory.

Once that is done, a new window will pop up on the left-hand side of the screen in the Tile Set View

Press the ``Add Template`` button and this will appear in the side toolbar:

You can modify the following properties of a tile:
	* **Height:** Height of the tile
	* **Thickness:** How small or large the tile will be (max: 1.00)
	* **X Position:** The X position within the grid of the mesh
	* **Y Position:** The Y position within the grid of the mesh
	* **Material:** The material which the tile will use

**Example of changing the thickness**

*Left: Tile thickness of .25*

*Right: Tile thickness of 1.00*
